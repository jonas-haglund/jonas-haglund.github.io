This paper presents a monitor in a hypervisor with the purpose of making sure that a Linux guest cannot configure the NIC (described in Trustworthy Isolation of DMA Devices) to break isolation (i.e. access memory regions allocated to the hypervisor or any other guest). It is also motivated in detail why the monitor ensures this isolation.
