I am a postdoctoral researcher in the [Systems Software Research Group](https://www.ssrg.ece.vt.edu/) at [Virginia Tech](https://www.vt.edu/). My research interest concerns construction of reliable computers; more specifically, low-level software (e.g. operating systems software configuring hardware), hardware (e.g. I/O devices) and formal verification (mainly interactive theorem proving).
